JetGridBuilder plugin for Elementor helps to create wow-layouts on your website. Forget about the inflexible limits of premade grids. Put your ideas in motion just by dragging the posts to the desired grid area.

== Description ==

Form your Elementor grid gallery with blog posts, advertising banners, or shop products. You can create a layout with architecture projects, photographer portfolio, event posters, etc.

**Unpacking the plugin, you will find 2 widgets inside:** 

 - Post Grid Builder  
 - Terms Grid Builder

No need to respect the row height, just place your posts in any order. Manually change the size, gutter, etc. Crocoblock promises the lightest code, most responsive design options, and the easiest user experience in the field.

**The opportunities you get with JetGridBuilder:**

 1. Choosing any number of columns to create a sophisticated grid
 2. Adjusting the layout of any difficulty
 3. Setting the indent between posts with the help of Gutter 
 4. The empty space in the grid is filled in automatically with the Vertical Compact Option 
 5. Two item style options available by default: **standard** for the info to appear on the colored background under the image, **content overlay** to showcase the information on the translucent background over the picture
 6. JetGridBuilder works in combo with [JetEngine](https://bit.ly/35ieZhY) plugin. Use the Listing Grid created with JetEngine as a source and all data and stylizations will be displayed instead of the default ones
 7. A great number of style settings for every page element

We prepared an inspiring demo page, where you can play with the posts: adjust, move, delete or add them. Check out Elementor grid plugin —  JetGridBuilder — in action [https://crocoblock.com/plugins/jetgridbuilder/](https://crocoblock.com/plugins/jetgridbuilder/)
